## Setup

To Setup this project, first do 
```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```

This will install all the required dependancies and start the server on the url [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000). 

I reccomend deploying this application using **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)** for a serverless function.

A basic breakdopwn of the file path is this: 


This website was powered by create-kapp, below is the installation process for create-kapp

## Quickstarting using create-kapp

```bash
npm i create-kapp@latest -g
```

then run the create-kapp command to initialise this template.

```bash
create-kapp
```

You'll be promoted with this:

```bash
? Setup the project in...? Â»
# Use "." or "./" for the local folder.
# Use a foldername to setup the project in that folder. (It will be created if it doesn't exist)
```

Thank you for using this project! ðŸ’˜

If you do use it, please condier not removing credits, however I understand if you do!
